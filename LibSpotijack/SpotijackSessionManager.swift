/// `SpotijackSessionManager` coordinates a Spotijack recording session. It maintains a scripting bridge to Spotify,
/// Audio Hijack Pro and a recording session named "Spotijack" in Audio Hijack Pro. The session manager is responsible
/// for polling the applications and starting new recordings when the track changes in Spotify.
///
/// # Creation
///
/// `SpotijackSessionManager` can be used as a singleton (recommended) or an instance. The singleton is accessed via
/// the throwing `shared()` method which will launch and establish a scripting interface to Spotify and Audio Hijack
/// Pro. A new instance is created using the `init(spotifyBridge:audioHijackBridge:notificationCenter:)` method which
/// takes pre-established scripting interfaces as its arguments. This method is provided for the rare case where there
/// are multiple instances of Spotify and Audio Hijack Pro launched (and tests).
///
/// # Usage
///
/// For a new instance of `SpotijackSessionManager`, polling will be disabled. Use `startPolling(every:)` to start
/// polling at a given interval. Add observers to the manager's `notificationCenter` property to be notified of when
/// various aspects of the applications change.
///
/// When polling is enabled, changing the track in Spotify **will not** start a new recording. You must start
/// _Spotijacking_ using the `startSpotijacking(config:)` method do this. This method takes a
/// `SpotijackSessionManager.RecordingConfiguration` object which, amongst things, tells the session manager how
/// frequently to poll while Spotijacking. You can end Spotijacking using the `stopSpotijacking()` method.
///
/// ## Automatic Spotijacking Ending
///
/// Spotijacking will be automatically ended under a few circumstances:
///
/// - When the session manager encounters an error.
/// - When there are no more songs to play in Spotify.
/// - If the recording is ended by Audio Hijack Pro.
///
/// ## Errors
///
/// Most errors should be caught when using the throwing `shared()` method. However, an error could be encountered
/// while polling. Users should observe for the `DidEncounterError` notification which is posted if an error is
/// encoutered when polling.
